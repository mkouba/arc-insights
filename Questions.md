# Questions from Quarkus/ArC users

We have asked the community about what topics and areas of ArC they want to hear more about through following channels:

* [Google group](https://groups.google.com/g/quarkus-dev/c/78ucWI6DCjw)
* [Zulip topic](https://quarkusio.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/187030-users/topic/What.20would.20you.20like.20to.20know.20about.20Quarkus.20CDI.2FArC.3F)

Here is a quick summary of the questions we got:

1) It may be a bit off-topic, but one of the things I'm always interested in is how "separable" a framework is.
For example - how easy / possible would it be to deploy a POJO Java app that used ArC for DI?
2) This year I was working on porting some cdi extension solution to Quarkus, and managed to get it to work via build steppes. If I can suggest a topic, I would be interested in hearing more about the relationship between cdi and build steppes.
3) I have a question: is `@ConversationScoped` and `@SessionScoped` available without undertow?
4) I would like to learn more about the `@Named` annotation and why we should avoid using it.
5) [rephrased] Bean proxies - how they work, when you get them and how to treat field access in such cases.
6) And another topic is synthetic bean within the extension.
